# Ingress is an API object that manages external access to the services in a cluster, typically HTTP.
# Ingress exposes HTTP and HTTPS routes from outside the cluster to services within the cluster.
# Traffic routing is controlled by rules defined on the Ingress resource. You can see Ingress as directly connected
# to a Service. Cargo is using NGINX Ingress Controller
# Configures a load balancer or proxy server

# ! Use this file if your cluster has a public ip address. This will configure a let's encrypt certificate for you
