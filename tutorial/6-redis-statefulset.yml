# a StatefulSet manages Pods that are based on an identical container spec. Unlike a Deployment, a StatefulSet maintains a sticky identity for each of their Pods.
# f you want to use storage volumes to provide persistence for your workload, you can use a StatefulSet as part of the solution
# You can use stateful sets if you need
# - stable, unique network identifiers
# - stable, persistent storage
# - ordered, graceful deployments and scaling
# - ordered automated rolling updates
